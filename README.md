## Resources
- [W3Schools CSS Flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) and [CSS Tricks Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/): I used these resources to get a better understanding about how to use Flexbox for my layout.
- 6/12 and 6/19 class lectures: I referenced the class lectures to complete my color cards and chips.

## Comments
- I had some issues with my nesting on my form elements. I don't think I named my classes correctly because my styles wouldn't apply when nested.
- The ready-made pattern library template was super helpful, but I also think I would have learned a lot if I had to set up the files myself. In the future, I would suggest creating an assignment just around setting up the files for this project.
