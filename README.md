#### Resources
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3971880/how-to-make-shadow-on-border-bottom): I used this Stack Overflow thread to figure out how to add a border blow to my navigation menu.
- [Solved By Flexbox](https://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/demos/sticky-footer/): I used this resource to make a sticky footer.
- [CSS Tricks Z-index](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/z/z-index/): I used this CSS Tricks article to use a z-index for my article elements.
- [JQuery Drawer](http://git.blivesta.com/drawer/): I used the JQuery Drawer plugin for my hamburger menu.
- [CSS Parallax](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_parallax.asp): This how-to guide helped me add a parallax effect to my hero images.
- [CSS Tricks Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/): I relied heavily on this guide to use flexbox for positioning.

#### Custom JQuery
I used custom JQuery to create the button disable/submit effect on the contact form. I also added JQuery that changes the submit button back to a disabled state when the reset button is clicked (thanks to Brittany for that great idea!). I also used custom JQuery to create the modal that displays when the Log In button is clicked.

#### Plugin 1
[Drawer](http://git.blivesta.com/drawer/): I used this JQuery plugin to create my hamburger menu. It was fairly easy to implement, but I had issues getting a sticky navigation to work with the plugin.

#### Plugin 2
[Owl Carousel](https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/): I used the Owl Carousel JQuery plugin to create a slider effect for my testimonials. This is a great plugin that was easy to use and offered several different carousel options.

#### Deductions
I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

#### Comments

I absolutely struggled to get a standard desktop navigation menu to display. I'm not sure what I was doing wrong, but I couldn't get anything to position correctly. I decided to keep the hamburger menu so the navigation wouldn't be completely ugly.
